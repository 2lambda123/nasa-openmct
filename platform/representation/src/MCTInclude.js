         * Defines the mct-include directive. This acts like the
         * ng-include directive, except it accepts a symbolic
         * key which can be exposed by bundles, instead of requiring
         * an explicit path.
         *
         * This directive uses the following attributes:
         *
         * * `key`: An Angular expression, matched against the key of a
         *   defined template extension in order to determine which actual
         *   template to include.
         * * `mct-model`: An Angular expression; its value is watched
         *   and passed into the template's scope as property `mctModel`.
         * * `parameters`: An Angular expression; its value is watched
         *   and passed into the template's scope as property `parameters`.
         *
         * The difference between `parameters` and `mct-model` is intent;
         * `parameters` should be used for display-time parameters which
         * are not meant to be changed, whereas `mct-model` should be
         * used to pass in objects whose properties will (or may) be
         * modified by the included template.
         *
         * (For backwards compatibility, `ng-model` is treated identically
         * to `mct-model`, and the property `ngModel` will be provided
         * in scope with the same value as `mctModel`. This usage is
         * deprecated and should be avoided.)
         *
         * @memberof platform/representation
         * @constructor
         * @param {TemplateDefinition[]} templates an array of
         *        template extensions
