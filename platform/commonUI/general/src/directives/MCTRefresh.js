         * The `mct-refresh` directive may be used to explicitly
         * trigger the refresh of the contents of the HTML element
         * which has this attribute. When used in combination with
         * one-time binding, this allows templates (or sections thereof)
         * to eschew watches and instead use other strategies for
         * change detection.
         *
         * The `mct-refresh` directive is applied as an attribute
         * whose value should be an Angular expression which:
         *
         * * Will be evaluated with a variable `callback`, which is
         *   a function that, when invoked, will trigger a refresh.
         * * May return a function which will be invoked by `mct-refresh`
         *   when the directive is no longer applicable; this should
         *   be used to release any resources associated with the
         *   above callback.
         *
         * Example usage:
         *
         * ```
         * <span mct-refresh="someObservable.observe(callback)">
         *     <div>{{::someObservable.getValue()}}</div>
         * </span>
         * ```
         *
         * @constructor
         * @memberof platform/commonUI/general
