# Security

Open MCT is a rich client with plugin support that executes as a single page
web application in a browser environment. Security concerns and
vulnerabilities associated with the web as a platform should be considered
before deploying Open MCT (or any other web application) for mission or
production usage.

This document describes several important points to consider when developing
for or deploying Open MCT securely. Other resources such as
[Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://www.owasp.org)
provide a deeper and more general overview of security for web applications.
