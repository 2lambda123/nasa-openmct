# Specificty of the following rules matters. If more specific rules comes first,
# less specific rules can not override them.
# For example, the following won't work as you may assume:
# /**/* <-- ignore everything
# !/src/**/* <-- don't ignore src/
# But still ignore test files in src/:
# /**/*.test.* <-- HERE: This won't work, is not as specific as `!/dist/**/*`, so test files inside dist or src will NOT be ignored.
# /src/**/*.test.* <-- But this will work, because it is more specific.

# NOTE! Although we ignored everything by default, NPM will not ignore special files like
# LICENSE.md, README.md, and package.json.

# Ignore everything,
/**/*

# ...but include these folders...
!/dist/**/*
!/src/**/*
!/platform/**/*

# ...except for these files in the above folders (these rules are more specific, so they will apply).
/src/**/*Spec.js
/src/**/test/
/src/utils/testing.js
/platform/**/*Spec.js
/platform/**/test/
# temporary: there's one .spec.js file not being executed, but should not be included.
/src/**/*.spec.js

# Also include these top-level files.
